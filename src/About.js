              Animated Pokémon adventures have been around for a long time—almost as long as the Pokémon video games. The main animated show, called Pokémon the Series, follows the journeys of a young Trainer named Ash Ketchum and his Pokémon pal Pikachu as they travel the world of Pokémon, visiting exotic destinations, making new friends, and meeting many interesting new people and Pokémon along the way. During their travels, Ash and his friends learn about teamwork, compassion, and fair play as Ash works toward his goal of becoming a Pokémon Master. The series has become so popular over the years that it has spawned a series of animated films that typically have Ash dealing with legends of the Pokémon world.

              In addition to Pokémon the Series, there have been animated limited series such as Pokémon Generations and Pokémon Twilight Wings that tell other stories from the world of Pokémon. There's also Pokémon Kids TV, which features animated videos like nursery rhymes and sing-a-longs that are aimed towards younger Pokémon fans.

              You can watch Pokémon animation at no charge online at Pokémon TV. There is also a Pokémon TV app available for mobile, Nintendo Switch, and other devices.
